excerpt: "Today, one of my chamber music coaches, Roman Totenberg, passed away at 101. He represented the vitality that music brings to life: the gentle power that comes from drawing a bow across a string, the life that even old hands can find in notes which are themselves hundreds of years more agèd than the player. His memory lives on in those of us who follow the same gentle path--the one that he showed us through his grace, his class, and his softspoken wisdom. Rest in peace, Mr. Totenberg, knowing that you touched us all."

# Roman Totenberg (1911-2012): Violinist, Teacher, and Gentle Man
Today, one of my chamber music coaches, Roman Totenberg, passed away at 101. He represented the vitality that music brings to life: the gentle power that comes from drawing a bow across a string, the life that even old hands can find in notes which are themselves hundreds of years more agèd than the player. His memory lives on in those of us who follow the same gentle path--the one that he showed us through his grace, his class, and his softspoken wisdom. Rest in peace, Mr. Totenberg, knowing that you touched us all.
