As a writer, I have had the opportunity to work with a number of copyeditors. 
Also, had opportunity to study with great minds in textual criticism.
Also worked as a web developer, thought deeply and read widely on typography in the modern era, separation of content and formatting. 

Copyeditors are stuck in a previous era. 

1. Content should be independent of its formatting. Structural elements of document especially, but also for emphasis, acronyms, and hypertext.

2. The underline is dead. Well, for anything except a hyperlink. Even then, it appears to be the undead.
