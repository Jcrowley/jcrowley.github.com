excerpt: "On the one-yer anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, I published an op-ed in TIME Magazine's Ideas section outlining a potential path forward. When I penned those words, I had no idea that a whole generation of teens would be the change we need, nor any idea that their voices would speak with such courage towards power structures that had deflected them only five years ago. Onward. Those of us with bullet holes in our hearts know it is time for reasonable measures to protect our schools and communities."

Onward. Those of us with bullet holes in our hearts know it is time for reasonable measures to protect our schools and communities.
