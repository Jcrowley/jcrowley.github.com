Each category in documents will generate a subfolder off base_url to contain the posts (by date) within that category. It is possible to use an array for categories, which will generate sub-subfolder off in the order of the array: category: [ category1, subcategory1 ] => /category1/subscategory1/2012/12/31/filename.html.

Categories that generate subdirs

2. blog: Blog

NavBar
Need a method to determine the active element in the navbar
There will be five elements

Home
About
Work (portfolio)
Blog (everything in one stream, breakdown to work and personal optional)
Contact

Define in _config.yml

navbar:
- 	text: Home
	url: /home/
	id: home
- 	text: About
	url: /about/
	id: about
-	text: Work
	url: /work/
	id: work
- 	text: Blog
	url: /blog/
	id: blog
- 	text: Contact
	url: /contact/
	id: contact
	
Each page would have a group attribute that would be required

Logic in NavBar would be this:
Would need to default to something or find second way to determine page status if left out...

in each page

define
navbar_id: about

Then in Liquid

assign current_bar = page.navbar_id
if page.navbar_id == false, infer the right navbar
	include a helper file that will output the right info
	send a note to the page: hey, assign a navbar_id to me
else use the logic below

on gen of each element of navbar

if navbar.id = page.navbar_id, then include current code
else: just have navbar element inactive
