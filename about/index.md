There is a saying: those who think something is impossible should not interrupt the person doing it. My daily work is being the person doing the things often considered to be impossible. It is fun, frustrating, and rewarding.

My work is to bridge the various institutions that make societies more resilient in the face of natural disasters. Given the chasms that exist between the myriad actors in risk reduction, preparedness, response, and recovery, many would thing this work to be impossible. After all, how does one get satellite imagery from an intelligence agency for use by a grassroots humanitarian mapping organization? It can be done. It __has__ been done.

Open innovation, open source code, open data, and open standards provide mechanisms to bridge organizations that cannot directly interact and who may hold entirely different beliefs about the nature of a problem. So I work at the intersection of systems: informal digital communities and formal humanitarian institutions; civilian agencies and militaries; for-profit and non-profit entities--working to ensure coordinated action across sectors during emergencies by making their operational data available in open data standards on open platforms. I also curate the Camp Roberts humanitarian experiments as a means to bring policy conversations into a safe space where responders, policy makers, and lawyers can solve shared problems in a field environment. I am a consultant at the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery at The World Bank Group](http://gfdrr.org), a researcher at the [Harvard Humanitarian Initiative](http://hhi.harvard.edu), an information sharing analyst at the [National Defense University's TIDES program](http://star-tides.net), and a public policy scholar at the [Wilson Center for International Scholars (STIP)](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/science-and-technology-innovation-program).

I hold an MPA from the [John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University](http://www.hks.harvard.edu), where I was the Robert C. Seamans, Jr. Fellow in Science, Technology, and Public Policy. I also hold an MA in the history of ideas from the [University Professors Program at Boston University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Professors_Program) and an MusB in cello and music history ( _summa cum laude_ with distinction), from the [Boston University School for the Arts](http://www.bu.edu/cfa/), where I studied with [Leslie Parnas](http://www.bu.edu/cfa/music/faculty/parnas/).

## For conference organizers...
