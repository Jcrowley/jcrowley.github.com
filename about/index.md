I work to open data across the disaster cycle: from risk reduction and preparedness to response and recovery. To create bridges between institutions, I work at the intersection of systems: informal digital communities and formal humanitarian institutions; civilian agencies and militaries; for-profit and non-profit entities--working to ensure coordinated action across sectors during emergencies. Because I believe that practice and theory must be fused in action to create change, I lead the Camp Roberts humanitarian experiments as a means to bring policy conversations into a safe space where responders, policy makers, and lawyers can solve technical problems in a field environment. I am a consultant at the [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery at The World Bank Group](http://gfdrr.org), a researcher at the [Harvard Humanitarian Initiative](http://hhi.harvard.edu), an information sharing analyst at the [National Defense University's TIDES program](http://star-tides.net), and a public policy scholar at the [Wilson Center for International Scholars (STIP)](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/science-and-technology-innovation-program).

I hold an MPA from the [John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University](http://www.hks.harvard.edu), where I was the Robert C. Seamans, Jr. Fellow in Science, Technology, and Public Policy. I also hold an MA in the history of ideas from the [University Professors Program at Boston University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Professors_Program) and an MusB in cello and music history ( _summa cum laude_ with distinction), from the [Boston University School for the Arts](http://www.bu.edu/cfa/), where I studied with [Leslie Parnas](http://www.bu.edu/cfa/music/faculty/parnas/).
